#### distinct

Kutori felt as if the conversation had just changed topics.
“Actually, what I really wanted to eat were you guys, but that would kind of be missing the point, right? And what I really really want to eat are humans, but I haven’t gotten his permission yet…”
Kutori was beginning to get the **distinct** impression that what they had been talking about wasn’t related to this at all. “S-seriously, wait a minute.”
“...Now that I talk about this, I’m feeling hungry.”

#### live on

Chtholly: My stupid disintegration never actually stopped, did it?
Ithea: So, you still decided to **live on**, yeah?
Ithea: Listen. I've got a story for ya, okay?（珂学第 9 讲，00:03:52~00:04:03）

#### means

Naigurato: We call them "dug weapons" now.
Naigurato: These instruments are our only **means** of fighting the 17 beasts.（珂学第 2 讲，00:11:45~00:11:51）

#### by means of

In the divide-and-conquer method, we divide the set of $n$ points in $\mathrm{\Theta}(n)$ time into two subsets, one containing the leftmost $\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor$ points and one containing the rightmost $\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor$ points, recursively compute the convex hulls of the subsets, and then, **by means of** a clever method, combine the hulls in $\mathrm{O}(n)$ time.（算法导论，第 33 章）

#### majority

That’s why I used my great skills to directly put a lid on the **majority** of your memories and seal it in. It was a makeshift emergency treatment, but, being my work and all, it won’t break easily.（珂学必修 5）

#### despite

**Despite** Willem being a local, they ended up having to ask one of the public golems, automated guards set up in the streets by the government, for directions.（珂学必修 1）

Kutori held her arm over her eyes and laughed emptily. Originally, she was meant to die at this battle. To intentionally make her Venom run berserk and burn the enemy to ashes by exploding herself. Because she had a sudden change of heart and didn’t want to accept that fate, she learned the proper way of wielding a Kaliyon from him. She learned how to fight as a Brave.

**Despite** all that, an unexpected death now loomed right in front of her face.（珂学必修 2）

#### hardship

“**Hardship** is more important than all, hm?”（珂学必修 2）

#### keep up

Hahaha, well, it seems I’ve gotten a lot weaker. I hadn’t held a sword in such a long time, so my body couldn’t **keep up**.（珂学必修 1）

#### racial

"Ahaha, no need to be shy. A lot of fairies don’t even make it to puberty, so you’re lucky you can even experience love, ya know?” 

"I-It’s not like I was looking at him in that kind of way.” 

"... I see. I'll go look for some stories with **interracial** marriage. They might be useful.” 

"Ren!? I don't need those!”（珂学必修 1）

#### cattle

“If you want to let your **cattle** graze freely, you first need to discipline them so that they return to their pens at the end of the day, right?"（珂学必修 3）

#### shave

Sayaka: Oh! That reminds me, Teshi.
Sayaka: Would ya please **shave** before the ceremony?
Sayaka: I'm going on a diet for it, ya know?
Teshi: She says as she's eating a cake.
Sayaka: I'll get serious tomorrow.（你的名字，01:36:46~01:36:57）

#### slip

I never protected anything.
I let it all **slip** through my fingers.（珂学第 12 讲，00:01:07~00:01:11）

#### bakery

From what I understand,
you've been working at that **bakery** for quite a while.（珂学第 7 讲，00:08:50~00:08:54）

#### miserable

Shoko said...
that I'll be **miserable** whenever I'm with her.
But I'm the one who made her unhappy.
It was me...（声之形，01:31:47~01:31:58）

#### mourn

“In other words,” Feodor interrupted, “you want me to be a replacement for that man you speak of so fondly. Do you really believe I’m so easily capable of loving other people or treating them like my own daughter?”
“W-well... um…” Lakish stammered weakly. “I’d like… if you could try being like that, I think?”
“That girl has decided she wants to die, and even now throws herself fully into making her fate a reality. You propose that I allow the scenario to form where she gives me a tearful farewell on the day of the operation, and then she explodes most fantastically as I **mourn** her?”
“T-that’s…” her voice cracked and broke.（珂学选修 2-1）

#### grasp

"I'm sorry," he said, then pulled his arm back. Kutori's hand fell away from his sleeve, clawed at the empty air, then, unable to find anything to **grasp**, curled up into a fist. 

"... idiot," she muttered. （珂学必修 2）

“Yep. You just happen to fulfill the requirements perfectly. Even though I can’t really **grasp** the complexities of the technique, as long as I can teach you Venom control and basic sword techniques, you should be able to master it completely.”（珂学选修 1-1）

“Hey, I want to ask you something,” Kutori responded, ignoring the question. 

“What?” 

“If... this is a hypothetical question, okay? If I were to die in five days, would you be a little nicer to me?” 

Silence. 

"... huh?” Willem failed to **grasp** what she meant.（珂学必修 1）

#### thoughtful

Of course, a full strength embrace would end up snapping Lakish’s body in half, so Naigrat hugged her gently, as if touching a marshmallow, but firmly enough to not let her prey escape. The ultimate hug, a skill which Naigrat had acquired after much blood, sweat, and tears.

“Lakish, you really are a **thoughtful** girl! I love you!”

“Eh? Eh? Eh?” Lakish fell into deep confusion.（珂学必修 5）

#### straightforward

“That's too far of a jump...” Willem gave Almaria a little poke on the forehead. “It's someone you don't know. She's **straightforward** and dedicated and kind and spoiled and uncompromising and simple and an idiot and simple and an idiot.” He didn't think he said too much. He could even add on another set of simple and an idiot.（珂学必修 4）

#### undertake

At the time he was only level 9, so his guild would’ve placed restrictions on the areas he could venture into or the kind of missions he could **undertake**, forbidding him from fighting overly powerful monsters.（珂学选修 1-1）

#### pay off

Eight million. That could **pay off** Willem’s sizable debt fifty times and still leave some left over.（珂学必修 1）

#### cast

I would never **cast** my cape aside, not in a thousand years!（珂学第 6 讲，00:07:03~00:07:06）

The guy that sealed my memory said he chipped away a little at the curse **cast** on Elq’s body.（珂学必修 5）

#### cast down

"... I see." Firu **cast** her eyes **down**.（珂学必修 2）

#### impact

The two bodies, one human and one cat, continued their descent. The faint light radiating from the girl futilely danced about in the air before disappearing. She didn't even have time to scream. The stone pavement, which had seemed so far away a moment ago, grew closer at an alarming rate. She inadvertently tightened her grip on the cat, which let out a shriek. Helpless against the pull of gravity, the girl closed her eyes and braced for **impact**.

A girl fell out of the sky. Judging from her figure, she was probably in her early teens, and also falling pretty fast. At that rate, she would soon have a violent collision with the stone covered streets, leaving a gruesome scene unfit for a peaceful early afternoon.（珂学必修 1）

"It's okay. Even if the encroachment is showing up a little now, your body is still pretty young. As long as ya don't go too crazy, it shouldn't progress much further. There won't be any harmful **impact** to your everyday life. I know someone who's suffered from it before quite well, so I can guarantee you that."（珂学必修 2）

#### obtain

In their current time setting, large printing machines were already being widely used, making books much easier to **obtain** compared to earlier times when each one needed to be copied by hand.（珂学必修 4）

Conflict is the natural fate of all living beings. Peace is unnatural, and thus it is valuable. That which is unnatural cannot be **obtained** by simply sitting around. Only after expending the necessary effort and paying the necessary sacrifices to suppress instinct and pursue reason can it first be **obtained**. Precisely because of its difficulty to **obtain**, peace is seen as such a beautiful thing.（珂学必修 5）

#### attain

Prove that your algorithm **attains** this time bound.（算法导论英文版 706 页）

When we evaluated this summation, we **attained** a bound of $\mathrm{\Theta}(n^2)$ on the worst-case running time of the algorithm.（算法导论英文版 1145 页）

“It’s simple. Just tell them ‘You’re unhappy.’” Feodor waved his hands. “I can already hear you trying to make it sound like a good thing, ‘You can be more happy’, or ‘I’ll make you happy’, but they’re all in the same vein. Though that might sound good, you’d just be claiming that all their happiness is fake, and your brand of happiness is the real deal. However happy someone was before, once they’ve believed those words, they’ll start thinking that they might not have **attained** happiness yet.”（珂学选修 2-2）

#### moral

“Is that something to be happy about?” Aiseia asked. “Also, Nephren, you seem to be playing the role of a pet. Is that okay with you?”

“**Moral** support is important.”（珂学必修 3）

#### accumulate

Looking down, he noticed for the first time that Nephren was walking alongside him. His inner debate had blinded him that much. He also noticed the snowflakes starting to **accumulate** on the ground.（珂学必修 4）

Of course, there weren’t actually any stains that stood out from the blade’s glinting metal; it had just **accumulated** a layer of dust thanks to it being stored for a time.（珂学选修 1-1）

Strassen’s algorithm is not quite as numerically stable as SQUARE-MATRIX-MULTIPLY. In other words, because of the limited precision of computer arithmetic on noninteger values, larger errors **accumulate** in Strassen’s algorithm than in SQUARE-MATRIX-MULTIPLY.（算法导论英文版 112 页）

#### in favour of

The main argument **in favor of** choosing Java was that it has a very large integer data type, called BigInteger.（Codeforces 66, Codeforces Beta Round #61 (Div. 2), A. Petya and Java）

#### loaf

Hey there, Shoko.
So today, I was able to score some really great bread.
See! It's awesome, like you're awesome.
Oh like really great bread is awesome, This **loaf** here is just like you.（声之形，01:26:30~01:26:45）

#### flour

He departed for town early in the morning to do some ingredient shopping. His loot included a hefty amount of **flour**, butter, eggs, milk, and sugar. Small quantities of honey, nuts, and dried fruits were also stuffed in the bag.（珂学必修 3）

#### owe

“I **owe** you girls something.” He smiled with just a slight hint of sorrow.（珂学必修 5）

#### shortly


Anyway, Tiat will be done **shortly**.

She's a sweet, responsible girl.（珂学第 4 讲，00:11:35~00:11:40）

#### nonsense

There has to be a better way to battle these beasts than what you've been doing, hasn't there?
A way with less sacrifice, with less self-destruction **nonsense**.（珂学第 3 讲，00:06:25~00:06:34）

#### popularity

Quasi Braves, second in strength only to the Church appointed Regal Brave, humanity’s greatest warrior, have enormous **popularity** with the public.（珂学必修 1）

#### strike

The comet is going to split in two and **strike** the town?（你的名字，01:08:54~01:08:57）

#### in vain

Because that would mean that the older fairies all died **in vain**!（珂学第 3 讲，00:16:37~00:16:40）

#### resist

You should have known better. We don't have the kind of power to **resist** Curiosity!（珂学第 1 讲，00:17:58~00:18:02）

#### drawback

Although the mail golem service was convenient, it was, however, not without **drawbacks**.（珂学选修 2-2）

#### merely

The young girls, **merely** 'objects' according to the documents, live out their days with an enthusiasm and energy uncharacteristic of inanimate weapons.（珂学必修 2）

#### in good/poor condition

As he expected, all of the swords were **in poor condition**.（珂学必修 1）

#### dye

And don't get any ideas about **dyeing** your hair.
I doubt that it's gonna bother Willem.（珂学第 7 讲，00:11:12~00:11:16）

An Emnetwyte would never have been able to achieve such a naturally vivid color, no matter what **dye** he used.（珂学必修 1）

#### adore

I didn't mean to offend, it's my opinion.   
I just think girls are cuter.  
It reflects the way they want to be loved.  
They **adorably** wish to be **adored**.  
Boys are cute too, just in a smellier way.  
And **adorable** applies to us?  
Come on, as a race, you're generally all born in this form, right?（珂学第 3 讲，00:14:02~00:14:17）

#### classic

Meanwhile, Nephren, who apparently stuffed her chestnuts into her mouth without waiting for them to cool down first, now had a bright red face and seemed to be in a daze. Lucie had to run off to the nearest public well and get some water for her. Watching Nephren make the **classic** beginner mistake, Willem recalled fond and nostalgic memories.（珂学必修 4）

#### plot

I’m an evil Emnetwyte, after all. If I’m going to **plot** something, it’s going to be a larger scale crime.（珂学必修 3）

#### fateful

She recalled that **fateful** winter when she’d first seen Willem practicing in that forest.（珂学选修 1-1）

#### hesitate

“If you ever feel like talking about it, don't **hesitate** to come to me. I may not be able to do much, but I can at least stay by your side.” 

With that, Nephren stopped talking. “Ah... thanks.” First Aiseia, now Nephren. Kutori really did have amazing friends. Forgetting her situation for a moment, she was overcome with a happy feeling.（珂学必修 3）

#### troublesome

Lantolq, on the other hand, proved to be **troublesome** for an entirely different reason. Everytime Willem pressed his fingers into her back, she let out a weirdly suggestive moan. Well, Lantolq did seem very mature for her age, but whenever he heard that voice Willem got the feeling that they were doing something inappropriate and had to pause his work.（珂学必修 3）

#### outcome

Nephren's body was hot as an inferno, yet at the same time cold as ice. Needless to say, she had ignited too much Venom. She had turned her back on life and abused that terrible power, knowing that each step took her closer to death. Now, there was only one possible **outcome** which awaited her: berserk. The immense, unchecked power emanating from her would blow away everything in the area with enough force to destroy a large Teimerre all at once in an overwhelming manifestation of destruction.（珂学必修 3）

#### handkerchief

“...Sorry.” He took out a **handkerchief** and held it out to her in apology.（珂学选修 2-1）

#### disguise

“Your new hat.” 

The sudden change of topic surprised the lost in thought Kutori, who almost fell out of her chair. 

“You’re taking pretty good care of it, aren’t ya? You stuffed it in your closet and never used it since, keeping it nice and clean.” 

“I-It’s not like that means anything! That hat’s only useful as a **disguise** for when I leave the island... I don’t need it when I’m here! Besides, why are you even bringing that up now?!”（珂学必修 1）

So it is really a trinomial coefficient **in disguise**.（算法导论）

#### mistaken

Fight on, Lakish, he cheered her on silently. As for Panival – while he wouldn’t go as far as to say she was **mistaken**, he at least wished she wouldn’t talk about him as if there was something wrong about him as a living being.（珂学选修 2-2）

#### brilliant

The blue haired girl led him around. Getting another chance to look at her up close, Willem readjusted his age estimate to about fifteen, based on human standards. A markless, she had a body and features similar to those of a human. What set her apart was her **brilliant** blue hair, evocative of a clear spring sky. An Emnetwyte would never have been able to achieve such a naturally vivid color, no matter what dye he used.（珂学必修 1）

#### classify

Galil and Park [125] **classify** dynamic-programming algorithms according to the size of the table and the number of other table entries each entry depends on.（算法导论）
